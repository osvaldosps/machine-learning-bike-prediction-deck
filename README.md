# Bike Rental Prediction with Machine Learning for a Bike-Sharing Business Deck

Bike-Sharing Business is the latest generation of bike-sharing system of a traditional bicycle rental business where the entire process, from membership, rental, and return, has become automated. Through this system, users can easily rent bicycles from certain locations and make returns at other locations.

One of the challenges for bike-sharing system service providers is to create a business model that is financially profitable for business owners and service providers, and can provide a positive experience for customers. Even though there is significant business development and increased interest, the demand is not always stable. Therefore, optimization is needed in order to maintain a more measurable investment ratio so as to minimize losses.

To optimize the bicycle procurement process, a system that can predict how many bicycles are needed each day might be needed, so that service providers can reduce operational costs and increase profits. The Machine Learning method can be used to predict bicycle needs by taking into account several features such as season, temperature, humidity, etc.

In this project, the best machine learning algorithm and parameters are determined to predict the needs of bicycles every day. In addition to the right Machine Learning model, there are also business insights and recommendations that can help improve the cost efficiency and operational efficiency of the bike-sharing system being analyzed.
